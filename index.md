# Behavioral Digital Twins for Smart Cities Workshop
### In conjunction with IEEE FG 2023, Waikoloa Hawaii, USA, Jan 4th-8th, 2023

# Program
Date: TBD  
Location: TBD

# Description
Digital twin is a virtual environment that allows us to simulate real world problems.
For digital twin, one of the most important factors is human behavior
modeling since it is required by many digital twin applications, such as crime
and accident prevention, mitigation strategies in natural disasters, autonomous
driving, health coaching and sports simulation. However, because of the complexity
of human behavior, there are still many challenges unsolved. To address
the challenges, multiple research fields need to be involved together, including
computer vision, behavior science, human-computer interaction and AR/VR.
This topic is germane to both computer vision and computational behavior
communities. In this workshop, we aim to facilitate further discussion on this
emerging research field from both technological and application perspectives.
The outcomes of this workshop are relevant to building behavioral digital
twins of pedestrians in smart cities equipped with sensor networks. During natural
disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, modeling behavioral patterns
may lead to mitigation policies with greater efficiency and effectiveness, can
identify cost-effective solutions to deliver public services, improve government
accountability vis-`a-vis citizens and track progress and impact.
This workshop will serve as a catalyst to bring diverse stakeholders together
so that new scientific languages/thoughts can be established, in an effort to
address the societal challenges of creating behavior sensing systems that account
for the diversity of people and their environments.
In this workshop, the topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
  
- Human pose estimation/tracking  
- Human action recognition  
- Human pose/action/trajectory forecasting  
- Visualizations of human trajectory/action  
- Human-human interaction analysis/forecasting  
- Human-object interaction detection/forecasting  
- Multi-sensor fusion for human behavior understanding  
- Applications of human behavior understanding/forecasting

Angjoo Kanazawa, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor in the Department
of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California
at Berkeley. Previously, she was a research scientist at Google
NYC with Noah Snavely and prior to that she was a BAIR postdoc at
UC Berkeley advised by Jitendra Malik, Alyosha Efros, and Trevor Darrell.
She completed her PhD in CS at the University of Maryland, College
Park with her advisor David Jacobs. Her research is at the intersection
of computer vision, graphics, and machine learning, focusing on visual
perception of the dynamic 3D world behind everyday photographs and
video.
