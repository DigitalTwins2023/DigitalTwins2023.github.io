<!-- Behavioral Digital Twins for Smart Cities -->
## Behavioral Digital Twins for Smart Cities Workshop
The 1st Workshop on Behavioral Digital Twins for Smart Cities will be held in conjunction 
with the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition 2023 [(IEEE FG2023)](http://fg2023.ieee-biometrics.org/).  
The conference will be held in Waikoloa Hawaii, USA, from January 4 to 8, 2023.  

## Program (tentative)
Date: January 6, 2023 (half day workshop in the afternoon)  
Location: TBD

## Description
Digital twin is a virtual environment that allows us to simulate real world problems.
For digital twin, one of the most important factors is human behavior
modeling since it is required by many digital twin applications, such as crime
and accident prevention, mitigation strategies in natural disasters, autonomous
driving, health coaching and sports simulation. However, because of the complexity
of human behavior, there are still many challenges unsolved. To address
the challenges, multiple research fields need to be involved together, including
computer vision, behavior science, human-computer interaction and AR/VR.
This topic is germane to both computer vision and computational behavior
communities. In this workshop, we aim to facilitate further discussion on this
emerging research field from both technological and application perspectives.
The outcomes of this workshop are relevant to building behavioral digital
twins of pedestrians in smart cities equipped with sensor networks. During natural
disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, modeling behavioral patterns
may lead to mitigation policies with greater efficiency and effectiveness, can
identify cost-effective solutions to deliver public services, improve government
accountability vis-`a-vis citizens and track progress and impact.
This workshop will serve as a catalyst to bring diverse stakeholders together
so that new scientific languages/thoughts can be established, in an effort to
address the societal challenges of creating behavior sensing systems that account
for the diversity of people and their environments.
In this workshop, the topics of interest include but are not limited to:  
  
- Human pose estimation/tracking  
- Human action recognition  
- Human pose/action/trajectory forecasting  
- Visualizations of human trajectory/action  
- Human-human interaction analysis/forecasting  
- Human-object interaction detection/forecasting  
- Multi-sensor fusion for human behavior understanding  
- Applications of human behavior understanding/forecasting

### Michael Zollhoefer

Michael Zollhoefer is a Research Scientist at Reality Labs Research (RLR) in Pittsburgh leading the Completeness Group. His north star is fully immersive remote communication and interaction in the virtual world at a level that is indistinguishable from reality. To this end, he develops key technology that combines fundamental computer vision, machine learning, and graphics research based on a novel neural reconstruction and rendering paradigm. Before joining RLR, Michael was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Stanford University and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. He received his PhD from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg for his work on real-time reconstruction of static and dynamic scenes.

#### Title
Complete Codec Telepresence

#### Abstract
Imagine two people, each of them within their own home, being able to communicate and interact virtually with each other as if they are both present in the same shared physical space. Enabling such an experience, i.e., building a telepresence system that is indistinguishable from reality, is one of the goals of Reality Labs Research (RLR) in Pittsburgh. To this end, we develop key technology that combines fundamental computer vision, machine learning, and graphics techniques based on a novel neural reconstruction and rendering paradigm. In this talk, I will cover our advances towards a neural rendering approach for complete codec telepresence that includes metric avatars, binaural audio, photorealistic spaces, as well as their interactions in terms of light and sound transport. In the future, this approach will bring the world closer together by enabling anybody to communicate and interact with anyone, anywhere, at any time, as if everyone were sharing the same physical space.
